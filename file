What is version control system..?

A version control system (VCS) tracks every alteration to a file or set of files, enabling developers to journey back to earlier versions and collaborate seamlessly. Centralized version control systems (CVCS) streamline this process by housing all file versions on a single server. Developers borrow a file to tweak, then return it with updates, all neatly stored and cataloged by the server. This method shines in its simplicity, offering a straightforward path for managing changes.

Yet, as teams grow and projects become more intricate, the distributed version control systems (DVCS) such as Git step into the spotlight. DVCS doesn't just centralize files; it democratizes them. Every developer holds the entire project history locally, empowering offline work and facilitating a tapestry of branching and merging strategies. This flexibility is a boon for dynamic teams aiming to weave together multiple project threads without tangling them.
